                                Hellooo bai, I've been contemplating and assuring myself about what I really feel for you. I sometimes think that you're too good for me, but I've admired you for years now. If what you said about how you feel for me was real, then I'm willing to take risks. And if your feelings ever change towards me, please let me know so that I'll be aware. But for now, I just want to get to know you a bit more as 'friends' :> </p>

                            <p>    
                            xoxo,<br>
